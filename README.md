HTML5 Kids Game...?
=========

This project utilizes the HTML5 [getUserMedia API] to manipulate the Canvas.

  - Currently the project is scoped to a single player game that will draw finger motion on a white board.
    - Version 0.2
  - There will potentially be a lobbying system that will delegate multi-player games in the next version.
    - Version 0.4     
  - The game might get more complex [i.e. follow the leader or draw a specific image]
    - Version 0.6

* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [jQuery] - duh
